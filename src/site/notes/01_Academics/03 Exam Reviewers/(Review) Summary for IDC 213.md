## Step 1: Appraise Directness
- [k] Does the study provide a direct enough answer to the clinical question in terms of the **patients (P), exposure (E), and outcome (O)**?
	- Compare the PEO of the clinical scenario vs. the PEO of the paper
	- The **exposure** for therapy research is the *treatment being evaluated*
	- The **outcome** for therapy research is the *condition being prevented*
- Assesses the **usefulness** of the article prior to reading it fully
- The PEO of the clinical question is only *similar* to the PEO of the paper thus, it is **indirect** evidence and must be taken cautiously

## Step 2: Appraising Validity
- [I] Validity is how close the study is to the **truth**. 
### Summary Tables
- [k] The more criteria that the study fulfills, the more valid the study becomes

| Question                                                                           | Look For                                                                | Importance                                                                          |

### Importance of Randomization
- [k] Passes criteria if you are able to see the keywords of **randomized** or **randomly allocated**
- Equalizes groups in terms of **known and unknown factors**
	- [!] A **matching** methodology seeks to equalize the groups based on known factors but is ==unable to account for unknown factors== therefore, the outcome may not be from the intervention but due to differences in unknown factors
- Eliminates **selection bias** as every patient has an equal chance to be part of a group

>[!clinical] When can randomization be foregone?
>- Subjects of interest are **very rare** 
>- One therapy is **clearly superior** in reversing course of disease termed **clinical equipoise**
>- **Emergency** cases where intervention is needed right away
>- Outcome of study is **harmful** (unethical)
>- Studies on **education**

### Importance of Allocation Concealment
- [k] Look for **concealment strategies** like use of sealed opaque envelopes, use of computers, third party not involved in study
- [i] **Allocation** refers to *assignment* of participants to various groups while **Selection** refers to *retrieval* of participants from the whole population
- [i] **Concealment** is when the *researcher* does not know which group is treatment and which is control when they are assigning groups (only Group A vs. B not Treatment vs. Control)
- Allocation concealment ensures that you cannot predict assignment until ==after the patient has been included in study== and that you cannot predict ==future assignments== based on previous assignments
- **Protects the randomization** done
- Address **selection bias**

### Importance of Similar Baseline Characteristics
- [k] Look for **comparison** in tables or in text
	- Tables in results can show p-values that compare demographics amongst the treatments
	- May say that the demographic characteristics did not differ
 - [!] Even with randomization and allocation concealment, groups may differ if the sample size is small
- Assess **compatibility** of group
- Magnitude of any difference is more important than the reported p-value
- Answers the question of **did the randomization work**

### Importance of Blinding
- [k] Look for **blinding strategies** e.g., use of *placebo*
- [k] Look for strategies to **withhold information** regarding patient assignment
#### Patients
- [I] You can only break blinding when **adverse events** occur as they need to know what was taken for the patient to be treated accordingly
- Prevent from subconsciously or deliberately **influencing their outcomes** especially if outcome is supposed to be subjective 
	- Non-blinding will result in **performance bias**
- Non-blinding will introduce **co-interventions** that influence outcome
#### Caregivers
- Prevents from subconsciously or deliberately changing the way they care for patient
	- [!] Affects how well the caregivers will look after the patients resulting in **performance bias**
- Non-blinding introduces co-interventions
#### Outcome Assessors
- Needed especially if patients and caregivers cannot be blinded
- May influence reading or interpretation of results as well as rigor in manner of determining outcome **(detection bias)**
- Researchers as outcome assessors may be influenced by knowledge of allocation in assessment of outcome

### Importance of Analyzing Groups in which they were Originally Randomized
- [k] Look for **intention-to-treat analysis** usually in the title page, abstract, or methods
- Non-compliant patients should be evaluated as they received treatment as **non-compliance is part of the effect of treatment**
- [I] Analyzing groups based on where they were originally assigned is termed as an **intention-to-treat** analysis while analyzing groups based on what treatment they actually received is called a **per-protocol analysis**
	- Intention-to-treat analysis tackles <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">real word analysis and assess effectivity</mark> of the drug while Per-protocol analysis tackles <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">ideal world analysis and assess efficacy</mark>
	- [!] Intention-to-treat analysis addresses **exclusion bias**

### Importance of Follow-up Rate
- [k] Look for **dropouts stated explicitly** or a **comparison of number of recruited vs. number of patients analyzed**
- Results of study can change if a significant number of patients are lost to follow-up 
	- [I] If outcome rates are much higher than dropouts rates, dropouts will not change the conclusion of the study
- Threatens validity if there are too many dropouts with unknown outcome
- [i] A **sensitivity analysis** refers to assigning worst-case scenarios to the treatment dropouts and best-case scenarios to the control dropouts 
	- [!] Addresses **attrition bias**

>[!brain] Sensitivity Analysis Example
>![Sensitivity Analysis Example.png](/img/user/assets/Sensitivity%20Analysis%20Example.png)
>- **Study A:** Worst-case treatment (11%) vs. Best-case control (20%) → Treatment still better
>- **Study B:** Worst-case Tx (1.1%) vs. Best-case control (0.2%) → Control better
>- **Study C:** Worst-case Tx (20%) vs. Best-case control (50%) → Tx better
>- **Study D:** Worst-case Tx (15%) vs. Best-case control (10%) → Results are soft
>- **Study E:** Tx Dropout is higher than Control Dropout → Possible treatment side effects
>	- Normally, the dropout rates between the treatment and control should be equal (implies that it is a **random event**)
{ #f537ba}


## Appraising Results
### Magnitude of Effect of Treatment
- [I] Determines how effective, ineffective, or harmful the treatment is 
- [k] Look for **point estimates**
	- **Dichotomous Outcomes**: Hazard Ratio, Relative Risk, Relative Risk Reduction, Absolute Risk Reduction (Risk Difference)
	- **Continuous Outcomes:** Mean Difference
- [!] Dr. Mantaring asks that RR, RRR, and ARR are to be expressed in decimals while NNT is supposed to be a whole number thus, round up to higher number if computed value has decimals

>[!formula] Relative Risk (RR) 
>RR is as the *risk of adverse outcome in treatment* vs. those who are untreated in control
>$$RR= \frac{Risk_{Treated}}{Risk_{Control}}$$
>- **RR>1** means that it is <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">harmful</mark>
>- **RR = 1** means that it has no effect
>- **RR<1** means that it is <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">beneficial</mark> such that the risk of adverse outcome is higher in those who are treated
>- [I] A lower risk = A lower harm

>[!formula] Relative Risk Reduction (RRR) vs. Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR)
>$$RRR = 1-RR=\frac{R_C-R_T}{R_C}$$
>$$ARR = R_C - R_T$$
>- **RRR >0%** means that the treatment is <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">beneficial</mark>
>- **RRR =0%** means that the treatment has no effect
>- **RRR <0%** means that the treatment is <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">harmful</mark>
>- [I] Opposite of RR interpretation

>[!formula] Number Needed to Treat (NNT)
>$$NNT=\frac{1}{ARR}=\frac{1}{R_C-R_T}$$
>- The lower the NNT, the more effective the treatment is

>[!clinical] Communicating Effect of Treatment
>- **RR:** Before treatment, the risk is 1 but after treatment, the risk is RR
>- **RRR:** Before treatment, the risk is 1 and the treatment reduces the risk by RRR. Now, the risk is only RR.
>- **ARR:** In 100 patients who do not get treatment, $R_C\times100$ die while in those with treatment, only $R_T\times 100$ die. The treatment reduces the number who die by ARR per 100 patients

>[!formula] Mean Difference
>$$Mean\ Difference=Mean_{Control}-Mean_{Treatment}$$
>- Provides a range of possible results
### Precision of the Estimated Treatment Effect
- [I] Provides the range of possibilities of a treatment
- [k] Look for **95% confidence intervals** around the estimates of effect or **p-value** 
	- [i] The **p-value** is the probability for a *type I* error
		- [k] p-value <0.05 means that the probability is so low that you will <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis</mark>

>[!brain] Interpretation of Confidence Intervals
>![Sample Conficence Intervals.png](/img/user/assets/Sample%20Conficence%20Intervals.png)
>- For RR, both ends of the interval are <1 thus, the treatment is significantly beneficial or superior
>- For RRR and ARR, the lower and upper limits are >0% thus, the treatment is significantly beneficial or superior

>[!important] Reading Confidence Intervals
>- Both ends are on side of benefit → Significantly superior
>- Both ends are on side of harm→ Significantly inferior
>- One end reflects *important* benefit while other end reflects *important* harm→Inconclusive
>- One end reflects *small* unimportant benefit while other end reflects *small* unimportant harm→Equivalent
>- One end reflects benefit while other end reflects *small* unimportant harm→Treatment is at least as good as or better than control (Non-inferior)

## Appraising Applicability

| Question                                                                                            | Look for                                                                                      | Importance                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Are there biologic issues that may affect applicability of estimates of treatment effectiveness?    | **Prior knowledge and experience** with disease                                               | Effectiveness of intervention depends on <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">sex, comorbidities, race, age, or pathology (SCRAP)</mark> of disease in question |
| Are there socioeconomic issues that affect applicability of estimates of treatment of effectiveness | Prior knowledge and experience of disease, **Socioeconomic issues** that affect applicability | Social, cultural, and economic context may affect how well the treatment works                                                                                  | 

- **Patient Compliance** may be affected by socioeconomic disadvantages such as poverty and lack of education
- **Provide Compliance** may be related to skill in implementing certain procedures and availability of necessary facilities

## Individualizing Results
- [k] Look for the patient’s baseline risk for the outcome based on <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">clinical presentation</mark> and the risk reduction from the study to estimate individualized ARR
- [!] Studies report *average effects* but the effect on your patient may not be average
- Important to also account for **patient-specific costs** for treatment

>[!important] Steps for Estimating Individualized Effects of Treatment
>1. Calculate **Risk of Treatment ($R_T$)** from the baseline risk ($R_C$) and RR
>	- $R_T=R_C\times RR$
>	- $R_C$ is derived ==from the literature== and is the patient’s risk for event without treatment
>	- RR is derived from ==study results==
>1. Estimate individualized ARR or absolute risk increase
>	- $ARR = R_C-R_T$
>2. Estimate individualized NNT
>	- $NNT= \frac{1}{ARR}$
>3. Estimate individualized cost
>	- $Cost\ to\ Prevent\ Additional\ Outcome=NNT \times Cost\ of\ Treatment\times Duration\ of\ Treatment$

# [[01_Academics/01 Lecture Notes/Evidence Based Medicine/03 Diagnosis Module\|03 Diagnosis Module]]
## Appraising Directness
- Compare the PEO of clinical scenario vs. PEO of the study
## Appraising Validity
### Was the reference standard an acceptable one?
- The reference standard for diagnosis should be the **gold standard** to have an ==acceptable establishment of the presence of absence of the disease==
	- [!] The gold standard does not necessarily have to be a test but instead can be a criteria (e.g., DSM-5)
	- [!] Acceptability also depends on context such as the setting (hospital vs. community) 
	- ~ In cancer, the standard would be demonstrating cancer cells in biopsy or other specimen while for infectious diseases, it is identifying offending infectious organisms from culture, special stains, or DNA of organisms using RT-PCR
### Was the *definition* of the index test and reference standard independent of each other?
- [I] If multiple criteria are used as the reference standard, the **index test should not be a part of the criteria**
- [!] Addresses **performance bias**
### Was the *performance* of index test and reference standard independent?
- Addresses limitation of **retrospective** diagnostic validation studies vs. prospective studies
	- [I] Retrospective studies need the patients to have underwent both the index test and the reference test while prospective studies reflect populations then subject them to both tests thus, for retrospective studies, the performance of tests are not independent of each other
- [!] Addresses **performance bias**
### Was *interpretation* of the index test and reference standard independent?
- Knowledge on the results of index test may influence interpretation of results of reference standard and vice versa and is especially true if ==results are subjective==
- [!] Address **detection bias**

## Appraising Results
>[!formula] Measures of Accuracy
>![Matrix of Computations.png](/img/user/assets/Matrix%20of%20Computations.png)
>- **Sensitivity**: Probability of *testing positive* among those *with disease*
>- **Specificity**: Probability of *testing negative* among those *without disease*
>- **Positive Predictive Value**: Probability of *having the disease* among those who *test positive*
>- **Negative Predictive Value**: Probability of *not having the disease* among those who *test negative*

- [k] **PPV and NPV** are the *clinically useful* values as the patients usually come with results and you need to determine if they have the disease or not; however, they ==change with prevalence of disease==
- **Sensitivity and specificity** are not clinically useful but are stable regardless of prevalence
	- They are **test characteristics** that allow one to <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">make choices on what test to use</mark>
	- [k] **SpPin**: Positive test in highly specific one→Rule in; **SnNout**: Negative test in highly sensitive one→Rule out

### Likelihood Ratios
- Ratio of probability of test result among those with condition of interest vs. those who do not have the condition of interest
	- ~ You are LR times more likely to get (result) if you have disease than if you don’t have the disease
- **Likelihood ratios** address limitations of measures of test accuracy thus, clinically useful
	- Tells how large the change in probabilities of having target disorder based on test results

>[!formula] Likelihood Ratios as Probabilities
>$$LR(+)=\frac{Sensitivity}{1-Specificity}=\frac{\frac{Diseased}{Positive}}{\frac{Not\ diseased}{Positive}}$$
>$$LR(-)=\frac{1-Sensitivity}{Specificity}=\frac{\frac{Diseased}{Negative}}{\frac{Not\ Diseased}{Negative}}$$
>- **LR+**: Probability of positive test with the disease to those without disease
>- **LR-**: Probability of negative test in those with disease and those without disease

>[!formula] Likelihood Ratios as Odds
>$$LR=\frac{Posttest Odds}{Pretest Odds}$$
>- **Pretest Odds**: odds of disease prior to the test 
>	- $Pretest\ Odds=\frac{Diseased}{Not Diseased}$
>- **Posttest Odds**: odds of disease after the test
>	- $Posttest\ Odds=LR\times Pretest\ Odds$
>$$LR+= \frac{Positive_{diseased}}{Positive_{nondiseased}} \div \frac{Diseased}{Non-diseased}$$
>$$LR-= \frac{Negative_{diseased}}{Negative_{nondiseased}} \div \frac{Diseased}{Non-diseased}$$

#### Interpretation of Likelihood Ratio
- [i] LR values range from **0 to infinity** 
- [I] LR 10 has the same magnitude as 1/10
	- LR 10 means you are 10 times more likely to get result if you have target disorder
	- LR 1/10 means you are 10 times more likely to get result if you do not have target disorder

| Value | Interpretation                                                                               |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| LR>1  | Result w/ Target Disorder > Result w/o Target Disorder → More likely to have target disorder w/ result                     |
| LR<1  | Result w/ Target Disorder < Result w/o Target Disorder → Less Likely to have target disorder w/ result|
| LR=   | Test neither increases nor decreases likelihood of having target disorder                                                                                             |

|      Value       | Changes       |
|:----------------:| ------------- |
|  \>10 and <0.1   | Large         |
| 5-10 and 0.1-0.2 | Moderate      |
| 2-5 and 0.2-0.5  | Small         |
|   <2 and >0.5    | Insignificant | 


## Assess Applicability
- [!] Only do so if the test is valid and the results are good
- [?] Are there biologic issues that may affect accuracy of the test? (SCRAP)
	- Usually not found in the same study 
	- Needs knowledge on biologic factors affecting test performance
- [?] Are there socio-economic issues that may affect accuracy of the test?
	- Social, cultural, and economic factors can affect applicability
	- [!] No matter how accurate the test, if the environment is unable to fund or support this test, it is not applicable

## Individualizing Results
- [?] How can I apply the study results to my individual patient? Will the results change my management strategy?

>[!important] Steps in Individualizing Results
>1. Calculate pre-test probability based on history, PE, and initial labs
>	- Ranges from 0 to 100%
>	- Basically the **prevalence** of disease prior to ordering a test
>1. Convert pre-test probability to pre-test odds
>	- $Pretest\ Odds= \frac{Pretest\ Probability}{1-Pretest\ Probability}$
>2. Perform diagnostic test
>3. Depending on test results, multiple likelihood ratio by the pretest odds to compute post-test odds
>4. Make decision to treat or not to treat
>	- [k] Post-test probability > Therapeutic Threshold → Treat; Post-test probability < Therapeutic Threshold→Dismiss Diagnosis
>		- The **therapeutic threshold** refers to the probability of disease that is considered high enough to warrant treatment
>		- The **diagnostic threshold** is the probability of disease that is low enough to dismiss diagnosis

>[!formula] Conversion of Probability and Odds

- Articles on **harm** usually look into whether the presence or absence of exposure increases chances of developing outcome of interest
- [i] **Case-Control studies** begin by recruiting patients with outcome and without outcome then retrospectively analyzes if there is exposure to harmful agent
	- First grouped according to outcome of interest then exposure is determined retrospectively
	- [!] Baseline characteristics may differ
	- [I] Ideal for <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">diseases with long latency periods and low incidence rates</mark>

### Did exposure precede outcome?
- Best answered by **prospective studies** such as RCTs and cohort studies where the ==criteria for inclusion is the absence of the outcome of interest==
	- [!] Cannot be done if the outcomes are **rare** (needs large sample size) or if it is an outcome of **long latency** (needs years of follow-up)
- While case-control studies are able to overcome the limitations of prospective studies, it is ==difficult to establish that the exposure preceded the outcome==
### Balancing Important Prognostic Factors at time of exposure and Statistical Adjustments
- [k] Most important validity criterion that influences outcome for a harm study
	- [I] A study is still valid even if there are different characteristics provided that statistical adjustment is done
- **RCTs** are the only design that <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">guarantees comparison groups are equal in both known and unknown factors</mark> that may influence outcome
	- [!] Unreasonable to do so if the exposure is harmful and is unethical to give harmful interventions unless it is only secondary to a primary outcome of benefit
#### Study Designs for Harm Studies
>[!multi-column]
>>[!info] Case Control Studies
>>- Still the best option for most cases
>>- Exposed population may have different characteristics vs. unexposed population that may affect outcomes
>
>>[!info] Cohort Studies
>>- Not feasible when outcome has long latency period or is rare
>
>>[!info] RCTs
>>- Unethical use for harm 
>>- Only acceptable if the primary intention of the study is benefit 
>>- Able to equalize known and unknown factors that may influence outcome

### Determining Exposure in Patients
- **Case control studies** are associated with <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">recall bias, recording bias, and interviewer bias</mark>
	- **Recall bias** refers to the inability to recall exposure amongst those with and without the outcome of interest 
		- [I] Cases are more likely to recall exposure vs. control
	- **Recording bias** is exemplified by cases (with outcomes) being hospitalized thus, having records of exposure vs. those w/o outcome especially if they were never hospitalized
	- **Interviewer bias** is when interviewers tend to be more persistent or probing amongst cases for exposure vs. controls
		- [I] Can be avoided by **blinding**
- [!] If an exposure is better determined by one group, it leads to a wrong estimate of relationship between the exposure and outcome

### Determining Outcome in Patients
- [I] Different ways of determining the outcome predispose to **surveillance bias** wherein the exposure of interest is followed up for the outcome more closely compared to those who do not have the outcome of interest
- Not much of a problem for case control studies as ensuring equal outcome determination is a part of the inclusion and exclusion criteria
- In RCTs and Cohort studies, this should be paid special attention to and may be avoided by <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">blinding people tasked to ascertain outcomes</mark>

### Adequate Follow-up Rates
- [I] The number of participants should be accounted for at the start, during, and at the end of any study
- Similar to therapy appraisal where there is a need for a **sensitivity analysis** (see [[01_Academics/03 Exam Reviewers/(Review) Summary for IDC 213#^f537ba\|here]])

## Appraising Results
### Assessing Association of Exposure and Outcome
>[!info] Measures of Magnitude of Harm based on Study Design
>- **RCT or Cohort:**  Relative Risk, Relative Risk *Increase*, Absolute Risk *Increase*, Number Needed to *Harm*
>	- RR can be used because you will have the data on **incidence** among exposed vs. unexposed
>- **Case Control:** Odds Ratio
>	- Odds ratios are treated like relative risks if the outcome is very rare 
>	- Vertical recruitment occurs and these studies are limited to **correlation** and not causation

>[!formula] Relative Risk
>Risk for developing outcome of interest among those who are exposed compared to developing the outcome of interest
>$$RR=\frac{True\ Incidence\ of\ Outcome\ among\ Exposed}{True\ Incidence\ of\ Outcome\ among\ Unexposed}=\frac{\frac{Outcome_{Exposed}}{Exposed}}{\frac{Outcome_{Unexposed}}{Unexposed}}$$

>[!formula] Odds Ratio
>Odds of having the exposure among those with outcome over odds of having exposure among those without outcome
>- **Association** between odds of exposure in those with outcome vs. odds of exposure in those without outcome
>$$OR=\frac{Odds_{Treatment}}{Odds_{Control}}=\frac{Outcome_{exposed}\div Outcome_{unexposed}}{No\ Outcome_{Exposed}\div No\ Outcome_{unexposed}}$$
>- Values range from 0 to infinity with a null value of 1
>- **OR>1**: Harmful
>- **OR<1**: Beneficial
>- **OR=1**: No effect

### Precision of Estimate of Risk
- [k] If confidence interval crosses 1, estimate is imprecise and study is inconclusive

>[!important] Interpreting Confidence Intervals for Studies on Harm
>- Both ends of CI are on side of benefit (OR<1) → Exposure reduces odds of unfavorable outcome
>- Both ends of CI are on side of harm (OR>1) → Exposure increases odds of unfavorable outcome
>	- [?] Is the lower limit large enough for you to stop the exposure or if decision will differ based on the lower limit of interval vs. if you base it on the upper limit of interval
>	- If interval is narrow (precise), the decision is the same if you use the lower or upper end of interval
>- One end has important reduction of odds while other end reflects important increase in odds → Inconclusive (similar chance for harm and benefit)
>- One end has small unimportant reduction of odds → Exposure has no effect on outcome

>[!multi-column]
>>[!info] Interval Estimate
>>- Accepts range of possibilities thus, more likely to be correct
>>- More useful as it suggests statistical significance (best and worst case scenarios)
>>- More intuitive than point estimates
>
>>[!info] Point Estimate
>>- Do not accurately reflect uncertainty of studies
>>- p<0.05 implies 95% CI of RR does not contain the value of 1

## Appraising Applicability
- [?] Are there biologic issues that may affect applicability of estimates of a harmful effect? (sex, comorbidities, race, age, pathology)
	- May be identified by **pharmacokinetic, physiologic, and pharmacogenetic studies** 
	- Answers are rarely found in the same article
- [?] Are there socioeconomic issues that may affect applicability of estimates of harmful effect
	- Cannot be found in article being appraised 
	- A poor or marginalized population may not have a choice or way to avoid the exposure

## Individualizing Results
>[!important] Steps on Determining Effect of Exposure on Risk to Individual Patient
>1. Get baseline (pre-exposure) risk of the outcome based on literature, patient census, or surveys
>2. Convert pre-exposure risk to pre-exposure odds
>	- $Preexposure\ Odds=\frac{Preexposure\ Risk}{1-Preexposure\ Risk}$
>3. Multiple pre-exposure odds by odds ratio to get the post-exposure odds
>4. Convert post-exposure odds to a post-exposure probability 
>	- $Postexposure\ Probability=\frac{Postexposure\ Odds}{1+Postexposure\ Odds}$
>5. Make decision whether you will advise to stop the exposure
>	- $ARI=Postexposure\ Risk-Preexposure\ Risk$
>	- $NNH = \frac{1}{ARI}$
>		- The lower the baseline risk, the higher the NNH 

# [[01_Academics/01 Lecture Notes/Evidence Based Medicine/05 Prognosis\|05 Prognosis]]
## Appraising Directness
- PEO of clinical question vs. PEO of the article
	- Exposure in prognosis studies are called **prognostic factors** which ==increase or decrease likelihood of the outcome over time==
## Appraising Validity
>[!multi-column]
>>[!info] Old Criteria
>>- Was the sample of patients’ representative
>>- Were patients or subgroup of patients sufficiently homogeneous with respect to prognostic risk
>>- Were unbiased criteria used to detect outcome in all patients
>>- Was follow-up rate adequate
>
>>[!info] Updated Criteria
>>- Were all important prognostic factors considered?
>>- Were unbiased criteria used to detect outcomes in all patients
>>- Was follow-up rate adequate?
>>- If clinical prediction rules are being tested, was a separate validation study done?

### Was the sample of patients’ representative
- [k] Look for the manner of recruitment
- Make sure that population of patients recruited by study is representative of patients with condition in question
- [I] Recruitment from hospital populations result in patients with more severe spectrum of the disease while recruitment from community will result in patients with less severe spectrum of the disease
	- Represents **selection bias**
### Were patients sufficiently homogeneous with respect to prognostic risk
- [k] No longer used for the new criteria as it is difficult to find a truly homogeneous paper and if non-homogeneous, statistical adjustments are needed
- Concerned with the representativeness of the population in order for the results to be generalizable
- [I] Summarizing the results is better done by grouping patients based on presence or absence of prognostic factors instead of getting the overall estimate prognosis
	- [!] Using the overall estimate prognosis results in overestimating risk in mild disease and underestimating risk in severe disease
- Prognosis is determined by the <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">characteristics of the patient and the disease</mark>


### Were all prognostic factors considered?
- Assess presence of **confounding bias** as there are many prognostic factors for a disease
- [I] All known prognostic factors must be controlled prior to assessing the new unknown factor 
	- The known prognostic factors will change over time but there are obvious prognostic factors present that should be considered
- If there are factors that are unaccounted for, the study is still valid provided that it is mentioned in the **limitations of the study**

>[!important] Steps in checking if all prognostic factors were considered
>1. Check whether all study patients had **similar risk**
>2. If risk is dissimilar, check if the **subgroups** had reasonably similar risk
>3. If there were none, check if there is a **system** to measure relative contribution of each risk to the overall risk (clinical prediction rules)

>[!info] Reporting Standards for Studies
>Standards on what should be written in case you are writing an article aobut a study
>- **Clinical Trial:** Concert statement
>- **Diagnostic and Prognostic Studies**: STARD Statement
>- **Observational Studies:** STROBE Statement

### Were unbiased criteria used to detect outcome for all patients
- [k] Look at the **outcome definition**, who ascertains the outcome, blinding of outcome assessors
	- Preferably, the standard or international definition should be used 
- Method of **outcome assessment** should be the same for both exposed and unexposed
	- Outcomes may be classified according to the objectivity by which they were determined (e.g., biopsy > imaging)
- [I] Crucial to define criteria for soft outcomes
	- [i] **Hard Outcomes** are relatively straightforward and understood by all like death while **Soft Outcomes** need to have an acceptable definition to the scientific community and appraiser like sepsis

### Were follow-up rates adequate
- [I] Address **attrition bias**
- Patients lost-to-followup have unknown outcomes which is very important in a prognosticating study especially if you suspect that the difference in prognostic factors are more likely among those who dropped out

#### Types of Cohort Studies
- **Prospective**: Planned, Own protocols are used while following up subjects with exposure
- **Retrospective**: Using data from someone else’s protocol to observe from point of exposure to development of outcomes
	- [I] Can be used to determine prognosis
- **Ambispective**: Combination of retrospective and prospective → Data is collected from the past and data will be collected in the future

### If clinical prediction rules are being tested, was a separate validation study done?
- [!] Only used for **studies with multiple prognostic factors** where there is interaction between the factors for a single outcome
	- Uses a *derivation cohort* and a *validation cohort* which should be separate to prevent bias
## Appraising Results
- [I] A **survival analysis** is a *timeframe* analysis and prognostic studies take into account time
	- [i] **Hazards Ratio** is similar to RR but ==corrected for time== and is the <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">mean relative risk for all timepoints</mark>
 - Results in prognostic studies can be expressed in pictures, numbers, or **Kaplan-Meier Curves**
 - [I] In Kaplan-Meier curves, the denominator changes over time as the people who have already died are excluded from the denominator 
	 - Visualizes survival over time and can be used to asses the risk of dying over time as opposed to studies on harm which only looks at one point in time
	 - x-axis usually represents time while the y-axis represents survival rate (0-100%)
		 - [I] Curves start from 100% for event-free survival while 0% is the starting point for event rates
### Definitions of Prognosis

| Expression       | Definition                                      | Examples                                                          |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Event Rate       | %patients with undesirable outcome over time    | Mortality Rate, Stroke Rate, Hospitalization Rate                 |
| Event-free Rate  | %patients who do not have the outcome over time | Survival Rate, Stroke-free Survival Rate, Pain-free survival rate |
| Average Survival | Average length of **time** before event occurs  | Mean Survival, Median Survival, Average time to event             | 

- Likelihood of an outcome can be expressed as a range via **95% Confidence Intervals** to give <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">best and worst case scenarios</mark> in terms of prognosis 
	- Narrower CI → More precise estimate
	- [I] Survival curves are more precise earlier on as there are more patients included at that point and as the study goes on, there are patients lost to follow-up resulting in wider intervals

## Assessing Applicability
- [?] Are there biologic issues that may affect applicability? (Consider the influence of sex, comorbidity, race, age, and pathology)
	- Applicability of findings from a study is affected by biologic factors
- [?] Are there socio-economic issues affecting applicability?
	- [k] Prognosis will almost always involve socioeconomic issues
	- Socioeconomic conditions can determine the quality of medical care that patients receive
	- Educational attainment, urban vs. rural areas can affect the outcomes

## Individualizing Results
- [k] Use the Kaplan-Meier curve and look at the most appropriate curve for your patient
- The more prognostic factors there are, the more difficult it becomes to estimate the risk for an individual patient
- Prognostic calculators have been developed that takes into account differing patient characteristics to estimate prognosis better
- Prognostic data informs a patient on what to expect about their condition 
	- Even valid prognostic studies may not alter treatment decisions but gives the patient a glimpse into their future

- [I] A non-randomized trial is accepted if it is a **quasiexperimental design** wherein, it is not a drug study
### Search for Eligible Studies
- Ensures that relevant studies (both published and unpublished) are not missed 
	- [I] Address **publication bias** wherein, articles with positive effects are more likely to be published over those who report no effects resulting in overestimated effectiveness of intervention
- Should include electronic medical databases like MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, etc.
- Search for unpublished literature may include writing to experts in content of review, pharma industry files, surveying conference proceedings, books of abstracts

>[!info] Funnel Plot

### Validity of Included Studies
- [k] **Garbage In, Garbage Out** principle: quality of output is determined by the quality of the input
- Check for selection bias, performance bias, measurement/detection bias, attrition/exclusion bias
- Assess quality of methods

### Reproducible Assessment and Extraction of Results
- Assessing the eligibility and quality of studies need judgement thus, subject to errors

>>- Most popular way of testing for heterogeneity
>>- p<0.10 indicates that it is quite probable that differences exist among studies that are ==not attributable to chance alone==
>
>>[!info] I<sup>2</sup> Statistic
>>- Provide information on *degree* of heterogeneity
>>- Describe percentage of variation across studies that is from heterogeneity rather than chance
>>- Only looks at <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">variations in outcome</mark>
>>- Value >50% indicates substantial heterogeneity 
>>- Value is found <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">next to the chi-square test in forest plot</mark>
>>$$I^2=\frac{Q-df}{Q}\times 100$$
>>- **Q**: Chi-squared
>>- **df**: Degrees of freedom 
>>	- $df= No.\ of\ Studies-1$

>- Columns include the study identifier, number of events in treatment group, total number of treatment participants, number of events in control, total number of control participants, and weight (depicted as boxes on the forest plot), point estimates and 95% CI, and graphic representation
>	- **Weight** is the combination of the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">sample size and number of events</mark> expressed in % and indicates the *influence* of the individual study on the pooled result such that ==studies w/ bigger sample size and narrower CI will have higher weight → larger box==
>- The bottom row (L→R) shows the total events in treatment group, sample size of treatment group, total events in control group, total sample size of control group, total weight (100%), overall treatment effect (RR), and overall 95% CI
>	- Overall treatment effect is depicted as a **diamond**
>- The chi-square test is depicted by the **P-value**
>- The I<sup>2</sup> statistic is seen beside the P-value

### Qualitative and Quantitative Summaries
- **Forest Plot** provides a quantitative summary
- **Summary Table of Included Studies** provides a qualitative summary and includes the summary of essential details, sample sizes, blinding methods, outcomes, etc. of the studies

## Appraising Applicability
- Overall results will give broad range of patients and we must decide if they apply to specific subgroups
	- [!] Take caution in using results from a *subgroup* analysis
- [!] At this point, you are not yet individualizing the results but just exploring issues of applicability

>[!important] Criteria for Determining whether finding from subgroup analysis is credible
>- Difference in effect between subgroups is big enough to be important
>- Difference in effect is *statistically* significant
>- Difference is seen *consistently* in studies
>- Difference seen *within studies* rather than between studies
>- Difference is *biologically plausible*
>- Subgroup analysis should be *pre-planned*
>- There should not be *too many* subgroup analyses

## Individualizing Results
- [k] Look for strategies of individualizing results (depends on the nature of the study)
- Studies report *average* results but the effect on the patient may not be average
