## Individualizing
>[!note]- If the baseline risk of AFF is 5.9 atypical fracture per 100,000 person-years (Curr Opin Support Palliat Care. 2020 Sep; 6(3): 348-354), what is the post-exposure risk after ≥ 5 years of bisphosphonates? The answer should be expressed per 100,000 person-years. Round your answer to 1 decimal place.
>Since the baseline risk is 5.9 per 100,000 person-years, the outcome is so rare that odds and probabilities can be exchanged for each other. The OR is derived from the computation in the prior number which is equal to 3.79
>$$Postexposure\ Risk=Baseline\ Risk\times OR=5.9\times 3.795=22.3905\approx 22.4$$

The answer should be expressed per 100,000 person-years. Round your answer to 1 decimal place.
>Similar to the previous question, the probabilities and risks are interchangeable. From the previous computations, the OR for those with >1 year steroids is 6.36

The answer should be rounded off to the nearest whole number.
