## Individualizing
>[!note]- If the baseline risk of AFF is 5.9 atypical fracture per 100,000 person-years (Curr Opin Support Palliat Care. 2020 Sep; 6(3): 348-354), what is the post-exposure risk after ≥ 5 years of bisphosphonates? The answer should be expressed per 100,000 person-years. Round your answer to 1 decimal place.
>Since the baseline risk is 5.9 per 100,000 person-years, the outcome is so rare that odds and probabilities can be exchanged for each other. The OR is derived from the computation in the prior number which is equal to 3.79
>$$Postexposure\ Risk=Baseline\ Risk\times OR=5.9\times 3.795=22.3905\approx 22.4$$
>- The original formula is $Post-exposure\ Odds=Pre-exposure\ Odds\times OR$

>[!note]- If the baseline risk of AFF is 5.9 atypical fracture per 100,000 person-years (Curr Opin Support Palliat Care. 2020 Sep; 6(3): 348-354), what is the post-exposure risk after > 1 year of steroids? The answer should be expressed per 100,000 person-years. Round your answer to 1 decimal place.
>Similar to the previous question, the probabilities and risks are interchangeable. From the previous computations, the OR for those with >1 year steroids is 6.36
>$$Postexposure\ Risk=5.9\times 6.36=37.524\approx 37.5$$

>[!note]- If the baseline risk of AFF is 5.9 atypical fracture per 100,000 person-years (Curr Opin Support Palliat Care. 2020 Sep; 6(3): 348-354), what is the post-exposure number needed to harm after > 5 years of exposure to bisphosphonates? The answer should be rounded off to the nearest whole number.
>$$NNH=\frac{1}{ARI}=\frac{1}{Postexposure\ Risk-Preexposure\ Risk}=\frac{1}{22.3905-5.9}=\frac{1}{16.4905}=0.0606409751\times 100,000=6,064.09751\approx 6064$$
>- We multiply the NNH by 100,000 because the baseline risk is measured per 100,000 person-years
