(assuming that such tests exist) Test A: Sensitivity 43%, Specificity 95%; Test B: Sensitivity 95%, Specificity is 43%.
>Neither Test A or B is appropriate since pretest probability > diagnostic threshold and therapeutic threshold → No need to test
>- The therapeutic threshold is the probability of disease high enough to warrant treatment
