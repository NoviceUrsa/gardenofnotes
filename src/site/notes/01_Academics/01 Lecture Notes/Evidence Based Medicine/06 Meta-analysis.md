# üìî Notes
>[!clinical] Clinical Scenario
>HPV vaccination for 14/F child due to advertisements of Kris Aquino on prevention of cervical cancer
>- Should you recommend HPV vaccination?
## Directness
| PEO      | Study                                          | Scenario                           |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Patient  | 15-26 year old females with ‚â§6 sexual partners | 14/F with no known sexual partners |
| Exposure | HPV Vaccination                                | HPV Vaccination                    |
| Outcome  | Prevention of Cervical CA                      | Prevention of Cervical CA          | 

- ! The study is not direct enough for the clinical scenario
## Validity
### Appropriate inclusion criteria
- **Inclusion criteria** for systematic reviews should include ==minimum methodologic criteria== appropriate for question being asked
- + The studies included used **RCTs** with endpoints being CIN 2+ lesions or cervical CA using **intention-to-treat** analysis
- **Systematic reviews** describe criteria for inclusion/exclusion of ==individual studies== as opposed to primary studies that focus on individual patients
	- Criteria is used to ==describe the quality of studies== included along with the ==population, exposure, outcome, and duration of follow-up==
	- If the appropriate study design is not available for a certain question, the inclusion criteria can be adjusted to accommodate study designs of the lower level

#### Best Study Designs based on Nature
| Nature of Study    | Appropriate Study Design |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Therapy            | RCTs                     |
| Diagnosis          | Cross-sectional; Cohort  |
| Etiology/Causation | Cohort; Case-control     |
| Prognosis          | Cohort                         |

#### Differences between ordinary, systematic reviews, and meta-analysis
>[!multi-column]
>>[!clinical] Ordinary Review
>>- **Synthesis** of management/diagnostic issue ==without focused clinical question==
>>- Does not involve a **systematic search** of literature in methods and ==may only contain articles that support its claims==
>
>>[!clinical] Systematic Review
>>- Includes **all literature** on a topic (both in support/against)
>>- Comprehensive, systematic, objective, and unbiased 
>>- Uses a **focused** clinical question
>
>>[!clinical] Meta-anlysis
>>- Subset of systematic review that **combines/pools** results of individual studies or patients provided the studies are ==similar enough to be combined==
>>- **Quantitative** analysis that provides more precise estimates of effect sizes
### Thorough search for eligible studies
- ! Look for specification of **computerized** search, hand searches of relevant journals, personal communication with researchers of the topic, and other methods to search for unpublished articles
- Missed articles are more likely to have negative results
- Ensures that relevant studies are not missed especially looking at unpublished articles as most published articles would have positive conclusions that overestimate effectiveness of intervention **(publication bias)**
#### Funnel Plot
- Plots results of studies against magnitude of benefit then analyzed for symmetry
	- The x-axis represents the magnitude of clinical benefit
- Symmetric plot means there is no publication bias
- Asymmetric plot means there are more publications towards benefit meaning that ==publication is non-random and is based on results==
### Assessment of validity of included studies
- Strength of conclusions in systematic review depends on validity of included studies
- Look for the quality scale of studies or descriptions of studies included
- Review validity of studies by determining if there is bias
### Reproducible assessment of studies
- High agreement among authors reinforces the credibility of studies
- Look for ‚â•2 authors evaluating the quality of included studies
## Appraisal of Results
### Overall results of review
- The smaller the RR, the bigger the magnitude of benefit while the bigger the RR, the bigger the magnitude of harm
- If studies are **homogenous** in terms of PEO and methodology used, it may be feasible to combine them with a meta-analysis
	- Reported with a **forest plot**
### Similarity of results across studies
#### Chi-square Test
- Indicates presence/absence of **heterogeneity** among studies
	- Most common way of testing
- When p-value < 0.10, it is probable that differences exist among studies that cannot be due to chance alone
#### I<sup>2</sup> Statistic
- Provides information on the **degree of heterogeneity**
- Quantifies the %variability in the summary estimate due to heterogeneity
- >50% can be from substantial heterogeneity
### Precision of results
- ! Look for the overall 95% CI if there is combination of studies statistically
- In forest plots, the narrower the diamond, the more precise the results are 
## Assessing Applicability
### Biologic issues

### Socioeconomic issues

### Credible subgroup analyses applicable to the patient
>[!important] Criteria for Credibility of Subgroup Analysis
>- Difference in effect between subgroups is big enough to be important
>- Difference in effect is statistically significant
>- Difference is consistently seen in studies
>- Difference seen *within* studies
>- Difference is biologically plausible
>- Pre-planned subgroup analysis
>- There should not be too many subgroup analyses
