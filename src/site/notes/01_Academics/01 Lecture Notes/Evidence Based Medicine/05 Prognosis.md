# üìî Notes
>[!clinical] Clinical Scenario
>75/M diagnosed with **hepatocellular carcinoma** in 2012
>- Underwent **wedge resection** for poorly differentiated tumor **>5 cm in diameter**
>- Alpha-fetoprotein on diagnosis is negative
>- ? Very poor prognosis from poorly differentiated tumors >5 cm
## Hazards Ratio
- Look at **mean survival per time** and summarize with HR
- Different from harm analysis where the endpoint is the point of comparison while for survival analysis, the rates will change with time and the endpoint always ends with one outcome
- Because survival changes over time, the denominator of the cohort also changes
	- At the start, everyone is surviving but there are different sample sizes depending on the stratification (in this case, baseline AFP)
	- People will die over time, thus the number of the surviving cohort changes at that point in time 

- ! The **derivation cohort** should be *different* from the **target cohort**

## Directness
| PEO      | Clinical Scenario     | Study                                                                  |
| -------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Patients | Adult HCC patient     | Adult HCC patient (Mean of 62 ranging 55-71)                           |
| Exposure | Negative Baseline AFP | Baseline AFP                                                           |
| Outcome  | Overall survival      | Overall survival by **log-rank test** graphed with Kaplan-Meier method | 
#### Patient Selection
- **Retrospective** review of National Cancer Database (project of Commission on Cancer of the American College of Surgeons and American Cancer Society)
	- Liver participant file was used to identify ==adult patients with HCC== regardless of status of treatment
	- Excluded those who has no reported AFP lab values
- **Stratification** of cohort defined by the ==highest recorded pretreatment or baseline AFP level== based on cut-off points established by previously published literature
	1. Negative AFP (<20 ng/mL)
	2. Borderline (20-199 ng/mL)
	3. Elevated (200-1999 ng/mL)
	4. Highly Elevated (>2000 ng/mL)
- Further analysis was performed on subset of patients who underwent **curative surgery, transplant, wedge resection, lobectomy, and extended lobectomy**

#### Outcome
- **Overall survival** determined by ==number of months from diagnosis until death or last contact== via Kaplan-meier method and compared with log-rank test
- Secondary outcomes include 30-day readmission, and survival rates in 1 month, 1 yr, 3 yr, and 5 yr
- Data were compared by Pierson's Chi-squared test or Kruskal-Wallis test when appropriate
- **Univariate Cox regression analysis** was done to identify factors associated with overall survival
	- Variables with p-value < 0.05 were included in multivariate analysis
- **Hazard ratios** and 95% CI were calculated for each potential risk factor to identify independent predictors of overall survival
- To confirm results of prior studies, multivariate analysis was repeated using different AFP cut-off values for the variable of interest
- Statistical analysis was repeated for curative surgery cohort using identical methods
	- Outcomes were **stratified and compared** by ==surgical procedure and baseline AFP==
	- Median survival was not analyzed due to survival times being longer than follow-up period
## Validity
### Considered all important prognostic factors
#### Identified Factors Considered
- Age
- Gender
- Race
- Charlson-Deyo Score
- Years since diagnosis
- Tumor grade
- Tumor size
- Surgical or procedural intervention
- Type of surgery
- Margin status
- Analytic stage group
- Facility
### Unbiased criteria for detection of outcome

### Adequate follow-up rate

### Separate validation study for clinical prediction rules


## Appraising Results
### How likely are the outcomes over time?

### How precise are the estimates of probability

## Assessing Applicability
### Biologic issues affecting applicability of estimates of prognosis

### Socioeconomic issues affecting applicability

## Individualizing Results
### Prognosis of disease in individual patient
