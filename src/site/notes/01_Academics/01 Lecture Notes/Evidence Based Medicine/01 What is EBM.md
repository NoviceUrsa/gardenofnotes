# üìî Notes
## Reporting Dichotomous Outcomes
- $Relative\ Risk=\frac{Risk_{treated}}{Risk_{control}}$
	- Treatment is **beneficial** if RR < 1 and **harmful** if RR > 1
- $RR\ Reduction=1-RR=\frac{R_c-R_t}{R_c}$ 
- $Absolute\ Risk\ Reduction=R_c-R_t$
- $Number\ Needed\ to\ Treat=\frac{1}{ARR}$
## Evidence-based Medicine
- **Conscientious, explicit, and judicious use** of current best evidence in making decisions about care of individual patients
- **Systematic** approach to clinical problem solving which allows integration of best available research evidence with ==clinical expertise and patient values==
- Systematic approach to **acquisition, appraisal, and application** of research evidence to guide decisions in healthcare
- ! The key process is to **acquire, appraise, and apply**

### EBM Cycle
![EBM cycle.png](/img/user/assets/EBM%20cycle.png)
## Need for EBM
- Not all questions generated by clinical environments are pursued with barriers identified being lack of time and forgetting
- Depending on stage of career, there are weeks that go by that you are unable to read about medical information **(readless weeks)**
- Clinical performance deteriorates over time 
## Practicing EBM
### Skills Needed
- Question formulation
- Literature searching
- Evidence appraisal
- Applying evidence
### Question Formulation
#### Elements of Well-formulated Research Question
- Patient, population, person
- Exposure or comparison (if applicable)
- Outcome
#### Tips

| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Patient/Problem         | Start with your patient and ask **how would I describe a group of patients similar to mine?** (Balance precision and brevity) |
| Exposure                | Ask **which main intervention am I considering?**                                                                             |
| Comparison Intervention | Ask **what is the main alternative to compare with the intervention**                                                         |
| Outcomes                | Ask **what can I hope to accomplish** or **what could this intervention or exposure really affect?**                          |

### Computer Literature Searching
1. Identify the concepts in the question phrased including the **population, exposure, outcomes, and methodologic filter**
2. Rank concepts according to importance
3. Expand concepts and intersect them sequentially as ranked
4. Examine yield for hits and misses and modify the search (if necessary)

### Appraising Evidence
>[!clinical] Guide Questions for Evidence Appraisal
>- Are the results valid?
>- What are the results?
>- How can I apply the results?

>- Directness
>- Validity
>- Results
>- Applicability
>- Individualization

### Applying Evidence
- Integration of **clinical circumstance, research evidence, and patient preferences** now defines **clinical expertise**
- **Disease** is the pathologic status 
- **Illness** is the constellation of symptoms affecting the patient
- **Predicament** is the sociocultural milieu that the patient is in 
#### Skills needed
- Clinical skills in history and PE
- Skills in eliciting personal and social history
- Clinical empathy
- Compassion

## Socioeconomic Predicaments

| Philosophy | Cumulative Benefits (use several interventions to maximize benefit) | Opportunity Costs (spending money on one intervention means that it cannot be spent on other interventions) |
| Assumption | Infinite Resources                                                  | Finite Resources                                                                                            |
